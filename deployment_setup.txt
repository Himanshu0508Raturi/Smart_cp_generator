# Deployment Setup Instructions for Smart CP Generator

## Creating requirements.txt file

1. Copy the content from 'project_requirements.txt' to a new file called 'requirements.txt' in your project root

2. For local development:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

3. For deployment platforms:
   - Most platforms (Render, Railway, Fly.io) will automatically install from requirements.txt
   - Some may need additional setup for spaCy model download

## Platform-specific notes:

### Render.com:
- Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
- Start Command: gunicorn main:app

### Railway.app:
- Automatically detects requirements.txt
- May need to add spaCy model download to build process

### Fly.io:
- Add to Dockerfile or use buildpacks
- Include spaCy model in build steps

### Replit:
- Dependencies are managed through the package manager
- requirements.txt used for external deployment
